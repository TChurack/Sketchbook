Some simple ruby scripts I wrote to familiarise myself with the language and its syntax.
first100Fib: Prints the first 100 fibonacci numbers
FizzBuzz: The classic interview question: Prints the first 100 integers but with multiples of 3 replaced by "Fizz" and multiples of 5 by "Buzz", while numbers divisible by both become "FizzBuzz"
sumScript: sums a series of integers through various loops and recursion (decimals will have only their whole number part considered) that are given as command line arguments in the form: >ruby sumScript.rb 1 2 3 4
listCombine: Takes two command line inputs of the form [1,2,3] or 1,2,3 and creates a new array by alternately taking an element from each argument. It then returns this as a string.
